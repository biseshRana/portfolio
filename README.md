# Portfolio

### A portfolio I coded to display my projects and personal information

## Introduction
This portfolio was coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio consists of 4 pages: the projects, art, about me, and home page. The projects page has all my projects and has a photo, video, and description for each one. My art page is just to show my art projects. The about me page has my contact information, background/goal, and an introduction to who I am. The home page has a link to all the other pages. 

## Running the code
There are two ways to run the code:
1) Click on the following link: [https://biseshrana.github.io/portfolio/](https://biseshrana.github.io/portfolio/frontPage.html)
2) Open the code in VSCode, and open a live server using a browser of your choice through the index.html file
