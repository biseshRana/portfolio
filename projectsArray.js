        description: 'This game is made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game features 3 buttons: rock, paper, and scissors. Each is identifiable through the emojis on the button and the subtitles underneath. Anytime you press a button, the program will also automate the computer to choose a random move. The players score against the computer is tracked in a paragraph statement below the button. Finally, on the left side of the screen, a picture of a real hand is generated to match both you and the computers respective moves.'

You cannot actually order anything on the site so the order button has been deactivated. Other functions, however, fully match functions of the Amazon homepage and shopping including: adding to cart, modifying quantity, calculating prices, choosing a delivery date, etc.'

        description: 'This app was made with React Native. The app is broken down into 3 sections: Current, Upcoming, and City. Current shows the current temperature, high, low, what it feels like, and the current weather. Upcoming shows the day, time, the highs, and the lows for the upcoming week. City shows the city name, city population, and time of sunset and sunrise. When opening the app, you may encounter a loading screen. Please be patient as the app is importing data from the API which may take a while. Furthermore, the app will also ask for your location, so please do not be alarmed and accept it as it is inevitable.'
